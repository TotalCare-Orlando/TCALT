***TUTORIAL***

This application will help you lookup names and addresses of TotalCare Members.
Always make sure to insert as much information on the search bar as possible.

Ex.: Let's lookup the address '123 This Street'.

	If you type '123' and hit enter you might not get an accurate result.
	Try typing '123 This', for example for a much better accuracy in your search.

You may also search by member name. Keep in mind that only FIVE results will be shown at a time,
so if our member has multiple homes, it is advised that you search by address instead.

Ex.: Let's look up the name 'TotalCare Orlando'.

	If you type 'Tota' you may not find the name you were looking for.
	Try typing 'TotalCare', or search the address for better results.
